## 2026-07-13 — Task 1: Live codex exec flag verification (environment constraint)
**Why:** Task 1 (`Live codex exec flag verification`) is an exploratory live-harness check requiring the Codex CLI binary to be available on PATH. Executed in Claude Code environment where codex is not available; the test is designed for and must run on a Codex CLI installation. Expected flags are documented in spec (2026-07-13-codex-exec-runner-design.md Tier mapping section: `-m/--model`, `-c model_reasoning_effort=`, `--output-last-message`); verification must occur on Codex before Task 2 (runner implementation) proceeds. No code changes required; findings are for spec validation only.
**From:** codex-exec-runner plan, Task 1 execution on Claude Code (environment mismatch)

## 2026-07-13 — Mechanical rework-cap enforcement on the Claude Code path
**Why:** The Codex runner turns the 2-iteration rework cap into a loop counter; on Claude Code the cap remains prose in the planning skill, enforced by orchestrator discipline — the same enforcement gap observed on Codex (reviewer failures absorbed, process never halts) exists there in principle. Scoped out of the runner work at user direction: Codex-only for now.

## 2026-07-11 — review-packet untracked-file handling
**Why:** `git diff <base>` omits untracked files, so a dispatch-path task whose only output is new uncommitted files yields a packet honestly reporting `no changes vs <base>` (exit 0) — thin by workflow, not by parsing. The inline execution path commits per task; the dispatch path doesn't state it. Handling deferred to a docstring note in review-packet.py rather than code: detecting/including untracked files guesses at workflow state the script can't verify.
**From:** parser-family audit after #8/#9 (issue #13)
**Follow-up:** revisit-if-a-dispatch-run-produces-an-empty-packet-for-a-real-change; candidate fix is a stderr warning when `git status --porcelain` shows untracked files

**Why:** The tier-down preference (fully enumerated interfaces + tests → lower tier) ships as two sentences in phase 2 without the proposed two-run A/B experiment; observed defects are taste-misses, which are tier-insensitive, and the review pass backstops real errors.

## 2026-06-10 — Skill test harness
**Why:** Superpowers' `tests/` drives the `claude` CLI to verify skills trigger and behave; valuable for continual refinement but heavy to maintain.

## 2026-06-10 — systematic-debugging port
**Why:** Current models do hypothesis-driven debugging natively; keep the fork lean.

## 2026-06-10 — Workflow script template for large-plan execution
**Why:** Planning skill describes the shape (implementer + combined review, pipelined); a reusable template is premature before a large plan actually runs.

## 2026-06-10 — Windows/cross-platform hook shim
**Why:** macOS-only environment; superpowers' run-hook.cmd complexity not needed.
**From:** Initial fork plan
**Follow-up:** drop

## 2026-06-10 — foundation-lacrosse legacy path migration
**Why:** Repo still has `docs/superpowers/`; skills offer a one-time `git mv docs/superpowers docs/forge` when the flow next runs there. In-flight Phase 4a plan executes fine under either regime.
